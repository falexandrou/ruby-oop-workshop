**An edupunk is someone who doesn't want to play by the old college rules.** Maybe you have interests that don't fit the academic mold. Maybe you're in a remote location. Maybe you have a family, a job, or other responsibilities and you can't take on life as a full-time student. Maybe you love new technology and new ways of learning. Or maybe you're just a rebel!"

Either way, there's tremendous value in pursuing an education or career on your own.

This challenge is based on the advice and wisdom laid out in Anya Kamenetz' book: [The Edupunk's Guide to a DIY Credential](http://edupunksguide.org/).

**Watch this interview** with Anya to learn more about her evolution towards writing the Edupunk's Guide.
